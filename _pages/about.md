Corey Jackson is an Assistant Professor in [The Information School](https://ischool.wisc.edu/) at University of Wisconsin-Madison and co-founder of the UW-Madision Collaborative Computing Group (or [Mad Collab](https://collab.ischool.wisc.edu/)). His research bridges human-centered computing, computer-supported cooperative work, and design epistemologies from fields such as organization studies and psychology. His work employs qualitative and quantitative methodologies and is informed by a socio-technical perspective. His research contributes to the design of open collaboration platforms and is directed by two complementary approaches: (1) documenting human experiences online and (2) implementing and evaluating system affordances. For more information, please consult his [vitae](http://cjacks04.github.io/files/CoreyJackson_CV.pdf) and [research statement](http://cjacks04.github.io/files/ResearchStatement.pdf) (both in PDF). Specific domains of interest include citizen science projects and scientific research groups.

If you are interested in researching, designing, and building social computing systems, please consider applying to our [PhD program](https://ischool.wisc.edu/programs/phd-program/).
