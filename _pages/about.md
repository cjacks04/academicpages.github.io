Corey Jackson is an Anna Julia Postdoctoral Scholar at [University of Wisconsinâ€™s Information School](https://ischool.wisc.edu/). He received his B.A. (2010) in Political Science (with a focus on International Relations) from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, a M.S. (2012) from the [Graduate School of Library and Information Science](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) (aka the iSchool) from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and a Ph.D. (2019) in Information Science and Technology from the [School of Information Studies](https://www.ischool.syr.edu), Syracuse University where he was advised by [Kevin Crowston](https://crowston.syr.edu/). During 2019-2020 Corey was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California Berkekley's School of Information where he taught in the Master of Information and Data Science program ([MIDS](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/form-data-science/)). 


His research bridges human-centered computing, computer-supported cooperative work, and design epistemologies from fields such as organization studies and psychology. His work employs qualitative and quantitative methodologies and is informed by a socio-technical perspective. His research contributes to the design of open collaboration platforms and is directed by two complementary approaches: (1) documenting human experiences online and (2) implementing and evaluating system affordances. For more information, please consult his [vitae](http://cjacks04.github.io/files/CoreyJackson_CV.pdf) and [research statement](http://cjacks04.github.io/files/ResearchStatement.pdf) (both in PDF). Specific domains of interest include citizen science projects and scientific research groups.

**Beginning Fall 2021, Corey will be a tenure track Assistant Professor in [The Information School](https://ischool.wisc.edu/) at University of Wisconsin-Madison.**
