A project focused on designing personalized privacy interfaces for mobile and desktop devices to reveal individuals' their privacy discrepancy.  We collect information about usersâ€™ privacy preferences and display a privacy discrepancy prior to users downloading an app. The purpose of this study is to help users make more privacy decisions which reflect their beliefs/concerns about privacy.
